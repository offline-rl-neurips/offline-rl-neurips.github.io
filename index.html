        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
	Cognitive science and artificial intelligence (AI) have a long-standing shared history. Early research in AI was inspired by human intelligence and shaped by cognitive scientists (e.g., Rummelhart and McClelland, 1986). At the same time, efforts in understanding human learning and processing used methods and data borrowed from AI to build cognitive models that mimicked human cognition (e.g., Anderson, 1975). In the last five years the field of AI has grown rapidly due to the success of large-scale deep learning models in a variety of applications (such as speech recognition and image classification). Interestingly, algorithms and architectures in these models are often loosely inspired by natural forms of cognition (such as convolutional architectures and experience replay; e.g. Hassabis et al, 2017). Empirical data from cognitive psychology has also recently played an important role in measuring how current AI systems differ from humans and in identifying their failure modes (e.g., Linzen et al, 2016; Lake et al, 2017).
        </p>
        <p>
The recent advancements in AI confirm the success of a multidisciplinary approach inspired by human cognition. However, the large body of literature supporting each field makes it more difficult for researchers to engage in multidisciplinary research without collaborating. Yet, outside domain-specific subfields, there are few forums that enable researchers in AI to actually connect with people from the cognitive sciences and form such collaborations. Our workshop aims to inspire connections between AI and cognitive science across a broad set of topics, including perception, language, reinforcement learning, planning, human-robot interaction, animal cognition, child development, and reasoning.

        <h3>Call for Papers</h3>
        <p>
	Cognitive science and artificial intelligence (AI) have a long-standing shared history. Indeed, even today many researchers have an interest in performing multidisciplinary research across the two fields. To this end, our workshop aims to inspire connections between AI and cognitive science across a broad set of topics, including perception, language, reinforcement learning, planning, human-robot interaction, animal cognition, child development, and reasoning. We are sourcing short, four-page papers (deadline: <b>February 5, 2020</b>) from cognitive science, neuroscience, and AI across two tracks:</p>

        <p> The <b>Research track</b> will highlight advances at the intersection of AI, cognitive science, and neuroscience. We welcome submissions on: </p>

	  <ul>
	    <li>AI systems which draw inspiration from natural intelligence,</li>
	    <li>Computational models of natural intelligence that leverage methods from AI,</li>
            <li>Demonstrations of failure cases of AI systems where humans or animals succeed,</li>
            <li>Datasets or environments for AI systems which target a particular aspect of natural intelligence,</li>
	    <li>Papers which address privacy and fairness in machine learning, using insights from the behavioral sciences, or </li>
            <li>Works which otherwise combine AI and cognitive science.</li>
	  </ul>

	  <p> The <b>Blue Sky Ideas track</b> will showcase longer-term ideas or positions on ways to connect AI with cognitive science. While we will not require such ideas to be fully instantiated in a working system, we do expect them to be grounded in empirical or computational evidence. We welcome submissions on: </p>

	  <ul>
	    <li>Aspects of cognition which are under-explored in AI,</li>
	    <li>The order in which the research community should solve cognitive tasks in AI,</li>
	    <li>How research in AI could inform research in cognitive science,</li>
	    <li>Survey papers which summarize one area of research in AI or cognitive science for researchers in the other field, or</li>
	    <li>Works which otherwise propose a longer-term idea or position about the intersection of cognitive science and AI.</li>
	  </ul>

	<h3> Submission Policy: </h3>

	  <ul>
            <li> Submissions should be a maximum of four pages, plus any number of pages for references and supplementary material. We ask authors to use the supplementary material only for minor details that do not fit in the main paper. </li>
            <li> Papers should be fully anonymized for double-blind review. </li>
            <li>Papers should use the <a href='https://github.com/ICLR/Master-Template/blob/master/archive/iclr2020.zip'>ICLR style file</a></li>
	    <li> Dual submission policy: we welcome submissions that have been published or are currently under review at other venues, including both full conference papers and workshops. However, all submissions should be shortened to four pages. </li>
	    <li>Evaluation criteria: Papers will be reviewed for topicality, clarity, correctness, and novelty; however, we welcome submissions which are still work-in-progress. Papers which are longer than four pages, clearly off-topic, or not anonymized will be rejected without review.</li>
          </ul>
